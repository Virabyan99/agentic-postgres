"""The router labels Compose cannot interpolate.

`compose.yaml` carries the identity labels and the network hint but neither
`traefik.enable` nor the router and service labels. A router label's *key*
contains the router name, and interpolation inside a label key is not portable
to `COMPOSE_MINIMUM_VERSION` (ADR 0013), so the keys are rendered here — once,
by the only component that holds a host manifest.

Values are deliberately *not* all rendered. `ACME_RESOLVER_NAME` and
`BASELINE_MIDDLEWARE_CHAIN` stay as interpolation references so that they keep
coming from the root-owned runtime env file rather than from the rendered
directory: an operator who can write a project's rendered output must not
thereby be able to change which resolver issues its certificate, or drop the
middleware chain from its routes.
