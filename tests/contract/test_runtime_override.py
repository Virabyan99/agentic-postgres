"""Router label keys are rendered; the values that matter are not.

A router label's *key* contains the router name, and interpolation inside a
label key is not portable to the Compose version floor (ADR 0013), so the key is
rendered here. The resolver and the middleware chain stay as interpolation
references on purpose: they come from the root-owned runtime env file, and an
operator who can write a project's rendered output must not thereby be able to
change which resolver issues its certificate or drop the middleware chain.
